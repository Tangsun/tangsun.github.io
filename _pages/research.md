Here is a selection of my research projects.

## Project 1: Time-Series Prediction for Chaotic PDEs

![Project 1 Image](/assets/images/research/project1-teaser.jpg)

This project focuses on developing novel machine learning models to forecast the behavior of chaotic partial differential equations (PDEs) while providing formal stability guarantees. Our method combines principles from control theory and deep learning to ensure that long-term predictions remain bounded and physically plausible.

## Project 2: Adaptive Control for Quadrotors

![Project 2 Image](/assets/images/research/project2-teaser.jpg)

In this work, we developed a meta-learning framework for adaptive quadrotor control, enabling the drone to rapidly adapt to unknown disturbances and changing payloads. The core of our approach is an automated mirror descent algorithm that tunes the controller parameters in real-time. This work was nominated for a Best Paper Award at L4DC.
