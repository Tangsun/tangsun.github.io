I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at MIT LIDS, fortunate to be advised by Prof. Navid Azizan. Prior to MIT, I completed my master's study in Mechanical Engineering, where I had the privilege to work with Prof. Ilya Kolmanovsky.

My research integrates control theory and machine learning to develop reliable and theoretically grounded methods for decision-making in complex dynamical systems. I focus on advancing the foundations of optimization and learning theory, with an emphasis on creating practical and efficient algorithms for robotic applications.

Building on this, I aim to develop safe and interpretable learning frameworks applicable to large-scale problems. This includes data-driven modeling of complex physical phenomena and decision-making under inherent model uncertainty.
